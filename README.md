## Hello, World!
This repository aims to date my studies, where I store and report all the contents of courses, events, lectures and workshops that I have taken.
Here may be contained notes and private content, if you are the rights holder or something similar, please contact me, the content will be removed as soon as I see your request.
OBS: Under no circumstances am I collaborating with piracy or the like.

Greetings, C4N0FF
